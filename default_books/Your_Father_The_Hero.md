# Your Father, The Hero
by Michael Nicosia


## Part I: The Hero Comes Home
------------------------------

You are kneeling by the cold, red brick fireplace when your father comes home. The large oak door to the cottage opens, letting in a blast of cold, making you shiver.

The doorway tightly frames a burly man with dark, wooly hair. He has dark eyes, accentuated by angular brows that stand out upon his face.

Your father wears a heavy bearskin cloak. Dressed in black, he blends into the gloomy darkness of the trees outside, lit only by the fading remnants of red glowing sunlight sinking below the treetops.

Pausing inside the doorway, your father surveyes the main room before slamming the door behind him and throwing his sword down on the floor. Blood leaks from the scabbard and pools thickly on the wood in a small circle.

You rub your hands to warm them.

“Good day, Father. How was the hunt?”

Your father frowns at the chill in the cottage. “It’s cold. Why isn’t there a fire going?”

“I’m sorry, Father, I forgot. I was outside practicing the sword.”


### Too Much To Ask
-------------------

Rage envelops your father’s face. He covers the ground between you quickly, picking you up with one hand.

"All I ask is that there be a warm house when I get home!”

Your father shakes your small figure in the air, the muscles in his arm bulging, though you know it isn’t too much. You've been in this position many times before.

“Is that too much to do for somebody who spends the entire day hunting beasts and protecting the land? Perhaps you would like to do it for me? Do you think you could have killed Garmash the Giant?”

“No, Father, I...”


### Betrayal
------------

“Enough,” says your father, throwing you to the ground. You land with a resounding thump.

“Get the fire going now. It won’t be warm in here for an hour, yet.”

“Yes, Father.”

You scramble in front of the hearth, hands shaking, and attempt to use the flint to start the fire.

Your father walks to the swinging door at the back of the main room, pushing his way through to the kitchen with a loud crack as the door slams against the wall on the other side. Before the door has begun to swing back, your father comes back through the doorway.

“Where is your mother?”

“She is out gathering berries for dinner, Father.”

“She hasn’t begun dinner yet?

You feel as if you've betrayed your mother. You know your father will be really angry soon. He's certainly in a bad mood today. “I...I don’t know, Father,” you finish in almost a whisper.

“There’s no hot water, either! How does she expect me to wash without hot water?”

You shrug, cowering against the edge of the fireplace, hoping to find some warmth there.


### Cleaning the Sword
----------------------

“Now that you finally have a fire going, go clean my sword.” Your father gestures to the large blade laying on the floor.

“Yes, Father.”

You run to pick up the sword and leave the house.

You lug the monstrous piece of metal and awkwardly close the heavy entranceway behind yourself. 

Your father had killed five dragons. Maybe six, if today had been a dragon. All of them single-handed.

You dance across the yard, pretending that you, too, could kill a dragon. You see the large wings beating a whirlwind while you stand against it and the heat of flames licking at you around your iron shield. Triumphantly carrying the sword out in front of yourself as best you can, you imagine the you can still feel the warmth of the kill on the metal and that it's steaming in the freezing weather.

_CHOICES:_
* [“Duck. Parry. Lunge. The kill!”](#oops-the-sword-is-stuck)
* [Clean the sword already!](#well-water)


### Oops, the Sword is Stuck
----------------------------

You managed to lodge the sword between two bricks of the well. Prying with all the strength your young body can muster you manage to remove the sword from the crack.


### Well Water
--------------

You lean the sword against the side of the well and begin to wind the crank, raising the bucket from the deep hole. The well is a few hundred meters deep, so it takes a few minutes before you begin to see the bucket rise with your rotations. The water will be pure, though, coming from so deep. Your breath steams with the work.

“Ellisande! Ellisande, get in here!” your father yells from the backside of the house. His voice echoes loudly in the small valley.

When you've brought the bucket all the way to the top, you remove it from its hook and set it on the edge of the well.

After digging a cloth from your cloak, you dip into the bucket, shivering at the iciness of the water. You then began to clean the dark greenish-red gelatinous ooze off the blade.

It had definitely been a dragon. The thick liquid collects in your cloth, staining it permanently, as you clean the edge to perfection. You then use a clean cloth to dry the sword.

_CHOICES:_
* [Clean the scabbard.](#clean-the-scabbard)
* [Skip it.](#should-you-sharpen-the-sword)


### Clean the Scabbard
----------------------

Setting the sword aside, you do what you can for the scabbard. It's not as easy to clean as the sword and there would be new stains in the hard leather to add to the old ones. You do manage to get most of the blood out. It will have to dry on its own before you can put the sword back in it, however.

Hanging the bucket back on the hook, you let it drop back down into the well.


### Should you sharpen the sword?
---------------------------------

_CHOICES:_
* [Sharpen the sword.](#sharpen-the-sword)
* [Skip it.](#once-more-into-the-fray)


### Sharpen the Sword
---------------------

You sit down with your back against the gray limestone of the well, producing a whetstone from your cloak to begin sharpening the sword.

You're not excited about going back inside while your mother is being yelled at. So, instead, you work on cultivating a flawless edge on the blade. You're getting quite good at it since your father has given you plenty of chances to practice.

You keep on sharpening as twilight deepens into night and your fingers numb. As the stars begin to form constellations, you stand and walk slowly toward the house. You know you have to return soon or feel wrath by your father’s hands again.


### Once More Into the Fray
---------------------------

The moonlight reflects off the soft stones of the cottage as you approach. They seem to offer safety and refuge, but as you push open the hard oak door you are faced with the reality of the situation.

Light pours out of the main room, partially blinding you as you adjust from the near darkness you are returning from.

Your father sits in his big chair in front of the fire, facing away from you, long shadows spilling across the floor where the lights from the lamps and fire cannot touch.

Sounds of your mother sobbing drifts in from the kitchen.

“Have you finished cleaning my sword?”

“Yes, sir.”

“About time. Now clean the floor. You’d better get all the blood up,” the cold, calm voice your father uses is more frightening than when he is angry.

“Yes, sir.”

Again producing the wet cloth, you scrub vigorously at the floor. Luckily, the blood hasn’t set into the wood yet and comes up easily. You then wipe it down with the drier cloth.

“It all came up, Father,” you offer, trying to make peace.

“Lucky for you...”


### A Kettle Full of Tears
--------------------------

You stand staring at the back of the big chair, dark and cold in comparison to the light that falls around it. Your father says no more.

You nod and walk over to the kitchen door and push. Your mother’s sobbing becomes louder as the door opens.

“Hush, woman!” snaps your father.

A strangled gulp is the only reply, but the sobbing subsides into a sniffle and an occasional low whimper.

You avoid looking at your mother as you go to the wash barrels in the corner of the kitchen to deposit the two dirty rags.

“It’ll be okay. It’ll be all right,” she says, not sounding terribly convinced herself as she works over the large cooking pot. It smells like mutton stew.

“I know, Mother. I know.”

Turning, you return through the swinging door into the main room.


## Part II: A Story
-------------------

“Child,” your father asks, but less a question than a statement.

“Yes, Father?”

“Come sit beside me and I will tell you about my day!”

_CHOICES:_
* [Hurry to your father's side.](#to-kill-a-dragon)


### To Kill A Dragon
--------------------

You perk up and run to your father’s side, sitting down in front of the large chair and your father. The warmth of the fire is pleasant after having been outside for so long. Your father reaches out and ruffles your hair.

“I fought and slayed a monstrous beast today!”

“A dragon?” you ask, knowing the answer already but wanting to hear it from your father.

“Yes, a huge one!” he says. “You would never believe one could get so big.”

“What did it look like?”


### Twice As Big As A House
---------------------------

“Well, it was twice as big as our house and green with scales as hard as gemstones. It had giant wings like those of a bat, each as long as the rest of its body, and a tail more muscular and powerful than any you could ever imagine. Its snout had more teeth than you could believe and its fires hotter than that from hell. When it beat its wings, I was pushed backwards by the torrent of wind.”

“However did you defeat such a terrible creature, Father?”

“With bravery and daring, I’ll tell you,” your father replies, smiling.

Leaning over, he whispers, “I stayed low, so the wind would have less impact upon me, and crawled up to him...closer, closer...using my shield to fend off the flames. When I knew I was close enough, I jumped for his neck and was able to climb onto his back.”

“Father, not on top of him?” you ask in awe.


### Hold My Ale
---------------

“I tell you I climbed right on top of the creature. And, oh, did he howl then!”

“What did you do next, Father?”

“He thrashed more violently than I’ve ever seen a dragon thrash. Back and forth, trying to throw me. But I am strong, and you know he couldn’t get me off. Centimeter by centimeter, I was able to move up the back of the devilish beast until I had him around the jaw! There, I took out my dagger and gouged out its eyes. They made the most disgusting popping sound.”

“Ewwww!” you giggle. “Did he die then?”

“Of course not. If it were that easy to kill a dragon, then they wouldn’t be worth my attention. Any weakling could do it. You have to be a real hero to kill a dragon.”

“Then what did you do?”


### Anatomy Lesson
------------------

“Well, you see, I’m smart about dragons. I know where their soft spot is, right inside the pits of their legs. But try getting there when they can see you going for them -- it’s not going to happen, believe me.”

Your father leaps out of the chair, caught up in the story.

“I jumped off the dragon. He was really angry by then, so I needed to be careful. He was swinging his tail, beating his wings, and spurting fire in every direction he could.” Your father waves his arms around wildly. “He had no idea where I was, though.

“And that’s when I did it,” he says, rolling across the floor. “Somersaulting underneath him, I brought my sword up into his left fore armpit. I wiggled it around then until I found his heart. That shocked him so much that he let me just stand back and watch him die. He cried. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a dragon cry before, but this one did.” The firelight plays across your father’s face, making his words more dramatic. “I will remember his death forever. The grandest thing I have ever witnessed.”

With that, your father stands straight and bows his head.

_CHOICES:_
* [Clap, “Hooray! Father, someday, I want to be hero, just like you.”](#one-hero-in-the-family)


### One Hero in the Family
--------------------------

Your father looks up at you and smiles. Then, he frowns.

Looking at the kitchen door that hasn’t moved for many minutes, he yells, “Ellisande! Where’s dinner?”


## Part III: Riders in the Valley
---------------------------------

As you crunch through the frosty, dew-covered grass back towards the house, you become aware of a group of riders coming down into the valley. They all wear purple. You run into the house to your father’s bedroom.

You knock quietly on the door, trying to disturb him as gently as possible. You don't receive a reply.

You crack the door open to peer into the blackness. Light from the main room plows into the dark bedroom in an angular line that runs across your father’s face. “Father?”

“What,” your father replies in a flat voice.

“Four riders approach, Father. And they wear Crown Purple!”

“At this time in the morning? They shouldn’t...I will be up soon. You will entertain our guests. Tell your mother to prepare something.”

“Yes, Father.”

You turn to go...

“And...”

You stop.

“Don’t disappoint me,” your father growls.

“Yes, Father.”


### Preparations
----------------

You shut the door to your father’s bedroom quietly and scurry to the kitchen where your mother is already busy preparing the morning meal. As you push through the swinging door, the smell of freshly baked bread intrudes your senses. Your mother makes the most wonderful combinations for bread.

“Mother! Four riders wearing Crown Purple approach! Father says to make something for them and to entertain them. He’ll be up soon.”

“This early? Your father must be very angry...” She didn’t have to mention that somehow it would become their fault. “Four, you say?” You nod in reply.

"We'll need more food," she says, turning to begin anew at preparing food.

You return to the main room, scanning the area, hoping that everything is perfect. It all seems in place and as perfect as it could be. Moving over to the window, you look out to check the progress of the riders, pushing aside the curtain so that you can see all four of them. They are just reaching the house. As they began to dismount, you quickly open the door and head outside.


### The King's Messengers
-------------------------

The four riders wear purple-striped riding pants and purple tunics with knighthood ranks over frilly white shirts. Their black leather boots look finely made. They all carry ceremonial swords that look to have never been used in real combat. Each rides a black stallion with a coat that gleams blue in the morning sun.

“Good day, sirs and dames.”

“Good day to you, young man,” one of the knights says. “I am Dame Moonchild. My companions and I represent King Genhrick and have come to speak with your father.” Dame Moonchild is a tall woman with long, dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. She is powerfully built for a woman and beautiful face with a strong jaw.

“My father is not ready at the moment and will be with you soon. He has requested you come in, though, and have something refreshing while you wait.”

The messangers follow you into the house where you sit them down at the table and disappear into the kitchen.

“Mother, they are here. Is there anything I can bring them?”

Putting four cups on a tray, your mother begins pouring some four-berry juice. “Take this to them. Tell them I will be out soon with some food.”


### Sweet Rolls and Silence
---------------------------

First, the conversation at the table consists of exclamations over how wonderful your mother’s sweet rolls are. After a while, it changes to mutterings about the weather turning cold. Then, it becomes an uncomfortable silence.

For a long time, you watch as the knights sit. The morning progresses as they devour anything your mother puts in front of them. Mostly, though, there is just silence and waiting.

Time passes and the sun rises out of sight of the window. The knights are clearly agitated.

More time passes and it is obvious they are anxious to be done with the place. You don’t think they would leave, but you aren’t sure what your father is doing.

_CHOICES:_
* [Continue to wait.](#a-royal-request)
* [Repeat the story of the dragon.](#a-retelling)


### A Retelling
---------------

"Did you know my father killed a dragon yesterday?"

"Yes, we paid him handsomely for it," replies Dame Moonchild.

“Well, it was twice as big as our house and green with...ummm...super-hard scales. It had giant wings like, uh, a dragon, each as long as the rest of its body, and a tail more muscular and powerful than any you could ever imagine. Its mouth had lots of teeth and its fires were really, really...hot.

The knights look around.

_CHOICES:_
* [Continue telling the story.](#a-story-teller-needs-experience)
* [Give up on the story.](#a-royal-request)


### A Story-Teller Needs Experience
-----------------------------------

You need to get it together.

You whisper, “He stayed low, so the wind would have less impact, and crawled up...closer, closer...using his shield to, umm...fend off the flames. When he was close enough, he jumped for his neck and was able to climb onto his back.

“The dragon thrashed. Back and forth, trying to throw him, but my dad is strong. Bit by bit, he was able to move up the back of the beast until he had him around the jaw! He took out his dagger and gouged out its eyes.

"I bet you think that killed the dragon. But, if it were that easy, you could do -- I mean, anyone could do it.

The knights are beginning to fade away again.

_CHOICES:_
* [Continue telling the story.](#perseverance)
* [Give up on the story.](#a-royal-request)


### Perseverance
----------------

“But, umm, my father is smart about dragons. Their soft spot is right inside the pits of their legs. But you can't get there when they can see you going for them -- it’s not going to happen, _believe me._

“He jumped off the dragon. He was really angry by then, so father needed to be careful. The dragon was swinging his tail, beating his wings, and spurting fire in every direction he could."

You wave your arms around wildly. “He had no idea where I was, though.

“And that’s when he did it,” you say, rolling across the floor. “Somersaulting underneath him, he brought his sword up into the dragon's left fore armpit. He wiggled it around then until he found his heart. That shocked the dragon so much that he let father just stand back and watch him die. He cried. Father's never seen a dragon cry before, but this one did. Father will remember his death forever. The grandest thing he's ever witnessed.”

The knights smile and there's a polite round of applause.


### A Royal Request
-------------------

When it seems that the knights are at their most uncomfortable, your father makes an entrance. Throwing his door open, he strolls out into the room, the picture of complete self-confidence. “Dame Moonchild, how nice to see you. You’re looking well.” His smile is almost pleasant.

She smiles back at him, her tension melting away. “Good day, Sir Gregory. On behalf of the kingdom, I bring you fifty gold coins in return for slaying the dragon. We apologize for our early intrusion, but we have some urgent business as well.”

“My services are at your disposal.”

“The Golmorith has freed itself from its cave. You were the one who was able to put it there. King Genhrick thought that you would be the logical choice to put it back.”

Your father looks at the four knights with a distant look in his eyes. “The Golmorith...after all these years.” He turns and walks over to the window, looking out across the valley. He adjusts the curtain in the window, pulling it into its correct position. He shakes his head, almost as if he is having a conversation with himself. Slowly, he turns.

“You have indeed come to the right person. I would be glad to rid you of your problem,” he smiles, “the usual fees applying, of course.”

“Of course,” the dame says. “Well, we must be on our way.” The others stand. “Thank your wife for her excellent food. And thank you in advance. Our kingdom is forever indebted.”


### It's Curtains For You
-------------------------

The knights depart the valley. You and your father watch as they ride out of the valley. Your father seems deathly quiet. Then, he turns and you can almost feel the heat of his anger. “Do you try to make a fool of me? Does that please you?”

You cringe. “No, Father, of course not...”

“Then why must you embarrass me?” Grabbing you by the ear, your father drags you into the house and plants you in front of the window. “You know how the curtains should fall. You know. And yet, you can’t seem to set them properly. Why is that, do you think?”

“I don’t know, father. I...didn’t...I mean...”

“Maybe you don’t think. Maybe that’s what you’re trying to say.” Your father shoves your head against the window before letting you go to storm off to his bedroom.

Your father leaves soon after the knights.


## Part IV: How I Met Your Father
---------------------------------

The next couple of days are peaceful for you. Your chores are easy enough to stay on top of and it leaves you plenty of time to practice the sword -- at least, when your mother isn’t making you learn to read and write.

You enjoy the time you spend with your mother. When your father is absent for days at a time, her mood lightens and the years seem to fall off of her. You can’t really get enough of it. The second night after your father left you ask, “Mother, how did you end up with Father?”

She pauses and looks up from her sewing. “Now why would you ask a question like that?”

“I don’t know...just curious.”

“Well, I was very young, a few years older than you, only fourteen. He came into town after having captured the Golmorith. He and Cristoph, your father's best friend, had gone out only two days before to destroy the creature.”

“What is the Golmorith?”

“A terrible creature, it’s said -- I've never seen it, myself. It’s a giant, hairless beast with thick black skin. They say it’s as tall as a tree and strong enough to pull one up. Christoph and your father went out to catch that thing and they did it. But Christoph didn’t come back. Your father says he was killed by the beast’s first swipe.

“When your father rode into town that day, sitting so proudly on his horse, he was quite the handsome hero. All of the young women wanted his favor and he could have courted any one of them. He asked me to dance at the ball held in his honor that evening. I would’ve been crazy to say no...I would’ve been.

“Anyway, we were married soon after, and here we are.” His mother reached over and squeezed his arm. “Just promise me something...”

You look at you mother quizzically.

“Don’t become --” She frowns. Then tries to smile encouragingly. She fails.


### Defeat
----------

You begin to worry about your father after the first week. Usually, his trips only last a couple of days. Three or four is rare. Five is unheard of.

You are sitting outside on the well, cross-legged and daydreaming, when you see a horse bearing a slumped rider coming down into the valley. You have a sinking feeling as you watch the rider approach. The gray horse becomes clearer and your fears are confirmed.

“Mother! Come quick!”

Your mother runs from inside the house. “What is it?”

“It’s Father! Look!” You point to where the horse is picking its path slowly down the side of the hill. “I think he’s hurt.”

“No...not your father...he wouldn’t be...” she stares up the hill with as much disbelief as you feel.

As the horse comes closer, you both run to it, trying to see what you can do. Your father has crude, blood-soaked bandages wrapped around his left shoulder and leg. His breathing is labored. “Help,” he whispers, pausing to take a breath. “Please, help me.”


### The Fever
-------------

You and your mother lead the horse up to the doorway and drag your father off the horse, trying to carry his massive form into the house. Together, you can barely support him, but you are eventually able to get him onto the bed in his room.

He is burning with fever, sweating every ounce of liquid from his body.

“Go get a pail of water from outside and some fresh cloths from the kitchen," says your mother. Quickly. Now.” Even in the dim light of the room, you can make out the fine details of your mother’s face and the pain it holds. “Go!”

Running from the house, you head straight for the well, where you retrieve a full bucket of water.

You then return to the house, a little less quickly for the bucket of water, and set the bucket down inside the bedroom before heading to the kitchen. In the kitchen, you find as many long, clean cloths as you can.

The kitchen door cracks against the wall as you rush back through the main room and into the bedroom. “I have them, Mother.”

“Good. Set them down.” She had cut away the crude coverings, exposing deep, festering wounds that look like something had just grabbed at the skin and tore it off. They are bleeding terribly.

Your mother takes a cloth and ties tightly around the shoulder, tight enough to slow the bleeding from the wound there. She does the same above the the wound on his leg.

Using the water, she cleans what she can, making the wounds look somewhat less frightening. "I have to sew these shut and remove the tourniquets as quickly as possible. I don't want him to lose a limb. Try to keep the wounds clean while I work."

She immediately begins with a thread and needle on his shoulder wound. You do your best to keep the blood out of her way. When the shoulder wound is sewn shut, she moves on to the leg and so do you. Soon, both wounds have been closed.

Your mother then folds cloths up and covers the wounds with them, tying them snugly with a knot to keep up the pressure. Last, she removes the tournequets.

“He should be better off now,” she says idly as she pats down his forehead with a water-cooled cloth. His breathing is still labored. The two of you begin to address other more minor cuts and scratches.

“Do you think he’ll be alright, Mother?”

“I don’t know.” The uncertainty is overwhelming.


### Awake
---------

The first few days after your father's return are rough. He drifts in and out of consciousness. When he is awake, the delirium keeps him from being intelligible.

The fifth day out, you sit on a stool staring at your father lying on the bed when he opens his eyes. At first, you dismiss it – he's done it many times before – until you see the flicker of intelligence behind the eyes that look at you from the bed.

“Father!”

“Child...”

“Mother! Father is awake!”

“Child...”

“Yes, Father?”

You mother comes into the room.

“Help me out of...”

“No, Gregory, you should stay in bed,” your mother says, coming into the room.

The glare that your father shoots your mother quiets her. Even hurt, he is sure to be in control. “Help me up.”


### Food
--------

You help your father sit up in bed. He is dizzy at first and almost falls over. “Food,” he whispers.

“I have some soup in the kitchen,” your mother says.

“Then bring it!” He coughs at the effort exerted in straining his voice.

Your mother leave to get the soup. In the meantime, your father swings his legs out over the side of the bed. He sits, weakly holding himself up.

Your mother returns with a bowl and your father greedily gulps down the contents.

Some strength renewed, he is able to stand with your help. He slowly walks out into the main room of the house and collapses into his big chair in front of the fireplace. “Wine,” he says.

You look at your father.

“Wine,” he repeats, more sternly.

You react, returning with a cup of wine, which is gulped down.


### Wine
--------

“More.”

_CHOICES:_
* [Refill the cup.](#wine)
* [Take the cup and don't come back.](#depression)


### Depression
--------------

It began like that. But it gets worse. Your father stays in a drunken stupor, sitting in front of the fireplace, talking to himself when he isn’t demanding wine or food.

The fourth night of this, he sits there, firelight shining off his sweaty brow, when he cries out loud, “I couldn’t beat him!”

You look over from the table where you are reading.

“I couldn’t beat him.” Your father looks at you, breathing laboriously.

You walk over and squat in front of your father. Tears run down his face. You've never seen that before –- not from your father.

“I could never beat him.” The stench of alcohol from your father’s breath wafts over you.

“What? Father, what are you talking about? You beat him all those years back.”

“No! Not...Not good enough.” Your father begins to rock, hitting his back against the chair, eyes glazed over.

“Father, you’re the best. You always have been.”

Your father laughs. A deep, maniacal laugh, disheartening to your ears. Even when your father had made you feel your lowest, he had always been a reassuring figure in your life. He had always seemed beyond petty emotions. But now he had given in to them completely. Self loathing, deception, and depression. They were all there.

_CHOICES:_
* [Slap your father.](#the-slap-heard-around-the-cottage)


### The Slap Heard Around The Cottage
-------------------------------------

In a decision that, were you to live that moment over again, ninety-nine out of one hundred times you wouldn’t make again -- you slap your father.

Anger flares in your father’s eyes. Enraged, he shoves you away from him. You fall backwards, the stone of the hearth digging into your flesh. You briefly think that it's done the trick, but then the burning rage dies as quickly as it was lit. Your father sits back in his chair and stares disconsolately into space.

“Father! You’re a great man. You can beat this beast. I know you can. I believe in you.”

Your father looks at you. More tears well in his eyes. “I can’t. I can’t,” he sobbed.

“Yes, you can!”

“I can’t...I’ve failed you. I tried to be the man you and your mother need, but I couldn’t. I wasn’t strong enough.”

“That’s crazy talk. You are strong. You beat Garmash the Giant. Could anybody else have beaten Garmash the Giant?”

Your father actually smiles. “Well, no...”

“Of course not. And has anybody else killed six dragons?”

His grin grows wider. “No.”

“That’s because you’re the best. The very best, Father.”

Your father does something monumental -- he pulls you close and hugs you affectionately.


### Recovery
------------

The next morning, your father is different. He doesn't yell at anybody and he even shares in some of the housework before going outside to stretch his muscles and see if he can’t regain some of his strength. He eats well and drinks none.

Soon, he is fully recovered.


## Part V: The Golmorith
------------------------

Your father readies to hunt the Golmorith.

“Father, may I go with you? I’ve never seen a monster.”

“I don’t think so. It’s going to be very dangerous.”

_CHOICES:_
* [“Father, please? I swear, I won’t get in the way. I just want to see it.”](#persistent)
* ["Okay, I understand..."](#leaving)


### Persistent
--------------

Your father thinks for a minute before answering.

“No. My best friend and partner died fighting,” he pauses, shaking his head, “that monster. I can’t let you come along. I can’t bear that kind of loss again.”


### Leaving
-----------

A little while later, your father leaves the house. You and your mother wave goodbye. Eventually, she turns and goes inside the house, but you watch as your father's horse makes the climb out of the valley.

As he peaks the edge, your father turns and waves before disappearing.

_CHOICES:_
* [Follow your father.](#following)


### Following
-------------

You make the decision. You _will_ see the monster. You just won't let your father see you.

You go to the stables, gather a horse and saddle as well as some travel rations you would need for the journey. You don’t have much, but you don’t think you will be gone for too long. A week at most.

You ride the brown mare. It isn't as strong as your father's horse, but you are light enough that it won’t matter.

Before your mother can catch you, you ride out of the valley in the footsteps of your father.

You have to ride hard for the majority of that day, trying to make up some of the ground between you and your father. It is late afternoon by the time you've determined you are a comfortable distance away.

Your father keeps a serious pace, stopping for water or to relieve himself infrequently. You ride through woods and valleys and over rivers until the last of daylight gives way to night and your father finally decides to halt.

_CHOICES:_
* [Light a fire.](#light-a-fire)


### Light a Fire
----------------

You dismount and lead your horse out of the way, so you won’t be detected. You tie the mare’s reins to a tree and set about trying to construct a camp.

You sit in the dark, trying to stoke a small fire, when your father speaks to you. “I told you not to come. But you came anyway.” He grabs the back of your shirt. “Why is that?”

“Please, father. I wanted to see the monster...” You squirm in your father’s grasp.

“You don’t understand...well, I guess you have me in a bind now, don’t you? I can’t spare the time to take you back and I can’t send you back alone.”

He laughs a little.

“You have too much of your father in you. Come on. Join me in my camp.” Your father lets go of you and walks back in the direction of his camp. You scurry to stamp out your meager fire and gather up your things.


### More About the Golmorith
----------------------------

The two of you sit next to the campfire, cooking a rabbit that your father caught, as your father explains things.

“When we get to the Golmorith, I want you to stay as far back as you can without losing sight of me. You won’t have any trouble seeing the beast.” The fire crackles and a branch breaks in the center. “He stands as tall as a tree.”

“Not as tall as a tree, Father?” you say in mock disbelief.

“Yes, and he’s as strong as ten horses. He stands like a man on two powerful legs, with charcoal black skin that is smooth and polished like ebony, hairless from head to toe. He would look like an overgrown giant, except for his impossibly wide mouth and eyes so large they take in the entire world without moving. His massive hands can crush a human’s skull.”

“How do you plan on beating him?”

“It’s time to sleep,” your father replies, avoiding the question. “Tomorrow will be a hard day.”

Your father smiles one of his rare smiles, leans over and smooths your hair, before lying down to sleep.


### The Volcano
---------------

You sleep and dream about trees that can walk and eat people. Your father wakes you at sunrise so that you can continue traveling.

As you travel, your father relates stories from his youth, when Christoph and he were still trying to make it as young heroes. It is very pleasant, talking with your father, and you think that you begin to understand him better.

Around midday you reach the inactive volcano and cave where the Golmorith had last been seen and fought by your father. It is nowhere around, though.

“Now what?” you ask.

“We need to check towns. He’s probably gone to feed.

_CHOICES:_
* [Continue...](#choose-a-town-to-search)


### Granite Falls
-----------------

You make your way into Granite Falls, a town of only about thirty buildings with houses and stores perched near the top of a giant waterfall.

Body parts are strewn about the street. In the middle of it all stands the Golmorith.

You vomit.


### The Beast
-------------

It is huge, bigger than you would have imagined. Black and hairless, the monstrous being must stand thirty feet tall, heavily muscled. Monstrous white eyes with small black pupils bulge from his flat face. His wide nose with flaring nostrils almost, but not quite, distracts from his gaping mouth that contains sparkling, razor sharp teeth.

Your father acts quickly, riding into the town, screaming and waving his sword in the air. “Hey you bastard! Look at me! Remember me? You thought you defeated me this time, didn’t you? But I’m alive! Come and get me!”

The monster looks at your father and drops the headless corpse it had been busy devouring. Your father wheels around and gallops out of town. The Golmorith follows.

You trail at a distance to see what happens.


### Doing As You're Told
------------------------

Your father leads the beast into the dense woods nearby. The beast is slowed by the thick, close trees, trying to squeeze between them in his attempt to chase down your father. You dare not get too close to the woods, for fear of becoming the object of the Golmorith’s attentions, but you can’t see what your father is doing.

You wait, as you were told.

The Golmorith screams and begins to swat the trees around him, trying to break free. You see smoke coming out from the woods, billowing in dark clouds. Flames begin licking all around the monster, spreading quickly. Your father comes hurtling out of the brush, smiling in triumph.


### Over the Edge
-----------------

The Golmorith has decided to not be finished yet, however, and begins to break its way out. Your father leaps off his horse. As the monster comes to the treeline, but is still encumbered, he begins to chop at the thing’s toes. It howls in anger but is not slowed a wink.

The creature breaks free and your father runs, mounts and rides away in one smooth motion. He gallops hard, but the Golmorith runs just as hard. You think they are headed straight for the falls and if you are right, your father will be trapped. There is nothing out there for your father to take shelter in. But at the rate the Golmorith is catching up to your father, you aren’t sure it matters.

As they near the edge, you can make it out more clearly and hear water in the distance. They are getting very close, but your father doesn’t appear to be slowing.

“No!” you scream. “Father, No!”

It's too late. To your horror, your father launches himself over the precipice. He drops out of sight.

The monster turns his head to look at you, but keeps on running blindly, and then screams as it tries to halt. But its momentum is too great and the Golmorith tumbles forward over the side.


### Face to Face
----------------

You slow the mare and then dismount, walking unsteadily to where you had seen your father make his heroic leap. Looking down over the bluff, you can see nothing for the long drop and the spray of water. You turn away, head swimming. Your father killed himself to save everyone. You fall to your knees, tears welling up and unable to breathe. Your father was the greatest man you’d known. He was a hero.

You hear a scrape and spin back to see the Golmorith pulling itself over the edge. Bile rises in your throat. The creature’s black skin pulls tight as it levers itself up. Then, it stares at you, a cruel smile forming on its mouth.


### The Death of A Legend
-------------------------

The creature’s muscles tense and it begins to move towards you –- you can almost feel the monster begin to kill you –- and then, the monster freezes, a large sword protruding from its belly.

It screams and totters forward. You scramble out of the way as it falls to the ground. Standing behind the beast is your father -- larger than life and as proud as can be.


### The Return of A Legend
--------------------------

“Father! You’re alive! I thought you were dead. I was so worried...And when the Golmorith came back...”

Your father climbs the Golmorith and wrenches his sword from its back, proceeding then to hack at the thing’s head. Blood splurts everywhere and stains your shirt. You suppose that's why your father wears black.

After your father had bagged the head, you try to hug him, but your father shrugs you off. “I told you to stay back,” he says coldly.

You are confused. “What...”

“You disobeyed. When we return home, you will be punished. Clean my sword,” he says, tossing the sword at you. You fall under the weight of the metal.
